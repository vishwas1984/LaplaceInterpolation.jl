# Summary

We introduce a linear-time algorithm for interpolation on a regular
multidimensional grid, implemented in the Julia language. The algorithm is an
approximate Laplace interpolation [@press1992] when no parameters are given, and
when parameters $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $\epsilon > 0$ are set, the interpolant
approximates a Mat\`ern kernel, of which radial basis functions and polyharmonic
splines are a special case. We implement, in addition, Neumann, Dirichlet
(trivial) and average boundary conditions with potentially different aspect
ratios in the different dimensions. The interpolant functions in arbitrary
dimensions.

# Mathematical Background

Radial basis functions and splines can be unified conceptually through the notion of
Green's functions and eigenfunction expansions [@fasshauer2012green]. 
The general multivariate Mat\'ern kernels [@stein1995] are of the form
```{=latex}
\begin{equation} 
K(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{z}) = K_{m-d/2}(\epsilon||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{z}||)(\epsilon||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{z}||)^{m-d/2}, \quad m>\frac{d}{2} 
\end{equation}
```
where $K_{\nu}$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind, and can be obtained as Greenâ€™s kernels of (see [@fasshauer2011reproducing])
```{=latex}
\begin{equation} 
L = (\epsilon^2I-\Delta)^m, \quad m>\frac{d}{2} 
\end{equation}
```
where $\Delta$ denotes the Laplacian operator in $d$ dimensions. Polyharmonic splines, that is, radial basis functions
of the form
```{=latex}
\begin{equation} 
K(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{z}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} ||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z} ||^{2m-d} & d \mbox{ odd,} \\
||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z} ||^{2m-d} \log ||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z} || & d \mbox{
even} 
\end{equation}
```
are a special case of the above, and this class includes the thin plate splines. 

The discrete gridded interpolation [@press1992,@mainberger2011optimising] seeks
to find an interpolation $u(\mathbf{x})$ that satisfies the differential operator in
$d$ dimensions on the nodes $\mathbf{x}_i$ where there is no data and equals
$y_i$ everywhere else. Discretely, one solves the
matrix problem
```{=latex} 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C} (\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{y}) - (1 - \mathbf{C}) L \mathbf{u} = 0 
\end{equation}
```
where $\mathbf{y}$ contains the $y_i$'s and placeholders where there is no data, $L$
denotes the discrete matrix operator and 
```{=latex}
\begin{equation} C_{i,j} = \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & \mathbf{x}_i \mbox{ known, } i = j
\\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise.} \end{array} \right. 
\end{equation}
```
indicates whether node $\mathbf{x}_i$ is observed. 

In $d-$ dimensions the matrix $A^{(d)}$ of size $M \times M$ expands the first order finite difference curvature and has entries
```{=latex}
\begin{equatioon} 
A^{(d)}_{i,j} = \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} -1 & j \in N(\mathbf{x}_i) \\
\sum_{j \in N(\mathbf{x}_i)} 1 & j = i \\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
```
where $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_i)$ is the set of neighbors of the node $\mathbf{x}_i$. Note
that if node $i$ is a boundary node, the row $A^{(d)}_{i,:}$ has $-1$s in the
neighboring node spots and the number of such nodes on the diagonal. %
(corresponding to a Neumann boundary condition).  In general, the rows of
$A^{(d)}$ sum to zero. 

Denote by $L = A^{(d)}$ the discrete analog of the Laplacian operator
in (4). To use the Matern operator, one
substitutes $L = B^{(d)}(m, \epsilon) = ((A^{(d)})^m - \epsilon^2 I)$ in
(4). Importantly, $A$ is sparse, containing at most 5 nonzero
entries per row when $d = 2$ and $7$ nonzero entries per row when $d = 3$ and so
on. The Mat\'ern matrix $B^{(d)}(m, \epsilon)$ is also sparse, having $2(m+d)-1$
nonzero entries per row. The sparsity of the matrix allows for the solution to
(4) in linear time.

# Statement of Need

While there exist numerous implementations of interpolation routines that fill
missing data points on arbitrary grids, these are (i) largely restricted to one
and two dimensions (ii) slow to run. The implementation we propose is
dimension-agnostic, based on a linear-time algorithm, and implements an
approximate Matern kernel interpolation (of which thin plate splines,
polyharmonic splines, and radial basis functions are a special case.)  

# Why is it so fast?

This is because the problem largely boils down to the solution of $Ax = b$
[@mainberger2011optimising] where the square matrix $A$'s size is the product of
the number of points in each of the dimensions, and is dense.  For the special
case where the data points are on a regular grid, and the Matern kernel
interpolant is used, a remarkable simplification occurs, in which a discrete
approximation to the Green's function for the operator results in an interpolant
having sparse matrix representation.  

# Other software for interpolation

## Julia 

* [Interpolations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl) does
  B-splines and Lanczos interpolation, and has support for irregular grids.
* [Dieerckx.jl](https://github.com/kbarbary/Dierckx.jl) a julia-wrapped Fortran

* [Laplacians.jl](https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl), whose function
`harmonic_interp` is similar to our vanilla implementation. 

## Python

* [astropy.convolve](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.convolution.convolve.html) will interpolate gridded data by rescaling a convoution kernel when it encounters missing values.
